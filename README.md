This is a Udacity DSND project on recommendation systems.

I analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like.

The **recommendations_with_ibm** notebook contains the following analysis:  

I. Exploratory Data Analysis

II. Rank Based Recommendations

III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

IV. Matrix Factorization


The dataset is from IBM Watson.
